Qt Trading software

This project was forked from qtstalker (http://qtstalker.sourceforge.net/) 2013-01-10. This was due to a number of reasons, but first and most important is that I since the summer 2012 have poked around in the sourcecode made a few bug corrections and a few changes to the project without having somewere to commit my work. At the same them I've been waiting for qtstalker to gain some momenum in the development but since nothing major have happend to that project since summer and it not open for collaboration I see no other path then to fork. With a fork I also gain a number of stuff. Most important: I can change to git.
